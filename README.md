# Masks Detecting Based YOLOv8 and Fast R-CNN

### Introduction

Our topic of project is about comparison of Faster R-CNN and YOLOv8 algorithms for face mask detection. And the topic is interesting because face mask detection has become a critical task in the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. Both Faster R-CNN and YOLOv8 are popular object detection algorithms and have been used for face mask detection. And our key target is to compare our models performance and find our best accuracy.

### Dataset

This project will compare the models using the Face Mask Detection dataset available on Kaggle. Firstly, when we get our dataset, we find our dataset including images and annotations. In our images set, it contains 853 pictures which can be used to train our model and test model’s accuracy. In addition, it contains images of people with mask, without mask and wearing mask incorrectly. Besides, there are 853 xml files record the photo’s information in annotations set corresponding to every photo in images set.

### Models

We choose YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN as our models.
